# Mapping Earthquakes

<img src="https://github.com/carlosjennings1991/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/map%20screenshot.png">

For this analysis, we plot earthquakes, major earthquakes and the tectonic plates across the globe. Users can also toggle the map styles and filter the earthquake data.

## Map 1: Earthquakes and Tectonic Data

This map shows every recent earthquake and the tectonic plate fault lines where they occurred. Size and color correlate to the magnitude of the quake i.e the greater the magnitude the redder and larger the circle.

## Map 2: Major Earthquakes

This map shows only the major quakes, i.e those 4.5 and greater.

## Map 3: Major Earthquakes + Fault Lines on the Satellite Layer

This map shows the major earthquakes and the tectonic plates (i.e the fault lines) but on a different tile layer, as seen on the control panel.
